The pass is located at a massive height of 3978 metres on Manali- Keylong road. When planning a trip to Manali, a day off to the vista point of Rohtang Pass is the ultimate and almost essential attraction of the itinerary.An experience of the snow can never be complete without a sledge ride, which involves sliding through the snow in a wooden toboggan. Another thrilling activity that can be pursued at Rohtang Pass would be mountain biking where you ride your mountain bikes off the regular course and into the lesser taken routes.
