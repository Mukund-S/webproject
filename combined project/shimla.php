The Ridge has everything, from shops selling some exclusive artefacts to the spectacular view of the snow-capped mountain ranges set against an orangish hued sky. This place is a delight for all kinds of tourists, and the old British establishments beckon visitors from all over to this centre of the beautiful hill station. The Ridge is the most recognised face of Shimla. It is often the most photographed part of the hill station covered with pine, firs, Himalayan Oak and Rhododendron trees.</h4></b></p>

The views and sceneries here only get better, and the landscapes more flattering, a bit untouched with the tourist rush.However, Kufri too is becoming increasingly popular with the visitors, especially due to the zoo here. One must visit Kufri's zoological park which is famous for having rare species of Antelopes, Felines, Bears and birds including Himalayan Monal, which is the state bird of Himachal Pradesh.
