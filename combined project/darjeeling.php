The construction of this 88-kilometre long railway line took place between 1879 and 1881, and a ride on this train route has been a coveted experience ever since. A journey in the Darjeeling Toy Train has amazing sights with pleasing mountain views and pass by villages and local shops on the way, with children merrily waving at them.</h4></b></p>

The magnificent view of snow-capped mountains sitting amidst cotton clouds attracts tourists to Tiger Hill from all over the country. Interestingly, this is also the summit of Ghoom, which is the highest railway station in the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The unique design of this magnificent attraction allows the track to wrap around itself through a hilltop tunnel. One of the most enchanting aspects of the Batasia Loop is its unmatched natural beauty which is a wonderful sight to behold. Located on Hill Cart Road (NH 55), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Darjeeling in all its verdant glory.</h4></b></p>

It serves as an ideal place to unwind and recharge amidst lush greenery and soothing winds. Since the Nightingale Park is at a slighted elevated terrain, you need to climb a few steps to reach the entry to this green haven. The park was closed for renovation for about four years and has reopened for the public since 2011. There is a giant statue of Lord Shiva, a musical fountain along with the great scenery.</h4></b></p>
