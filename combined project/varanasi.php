                     ghats often visited for recreation and during festivals. On typical days
                      about 300 people visit every hour in the mornings, and on festival days
                       2500 people arrive per hour. Most of the people visiting the ghat on usual
                        days are students from the nearby Banaras Hindu University. </h4></b></p>
